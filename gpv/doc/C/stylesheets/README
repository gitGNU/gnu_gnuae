This directory contains the XSLT stylesheets for DocBook 4.1.2 XML
->HTML transformation being considered for the GNOME Documentation
Project. A version of these stylesheets will be used for on-the-fly
DocBook->HTML conversion by GNOME Help Browser. These stylesheets are
customization layers for Norman Walsh's XSL stylesheets at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook (you'll need version
1.45). These stylesheets are intended for use with documents based on
GNOME templates but  will work with any DocBook XML 4.1.2
document. 

The stylesheets are a work in progress.  Any suggestions and 
comments should be directed at the GNOME Documentation 
Mailing List <gnome-doc-list@gnome.org> or to Eric Baudais 
<baudais@okstate.edu>.


INSTALLATION: 
 just copy all .xsl, *.xml files from this directory to your
 machine

USAGE: 

run your favorite XSL Transformation engine with stylesheet
general-customization.xsl, e.g. 

xsltproc -o outputdir/ path/to/general-customization.xsl yourfile.xml
  
Now create a subdirectory "stylesheet" in the outputdir and  copy (or
link) there all stylesheet images from Walsh's stylesheets (in
path/to/xsl-stylesheets/images/)  and file gnome-logo-icon.png
(usually in usr/share/pixmaps). 

NOTE ABOUT PATHS AND CATALOGS

general-customization.xsl refers to Norm's stylesheets using 
href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/1.45/html/chunk.xsl"

xsltproc (and probably other tools, too) will automatically use XML
catalog to see if you have a local copy installed; if not, it will go
and a  copy from the net. If xsltproc takes long time, then
your XML catalog is probably broken and it fetches stylesheets from
the net. To check whether your XML catalog is OK, type
 xmlcatalog /etc/xml/catalog  http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/html/chunk.xsl
(provided you have libxml2 installed)
If you get a local path
(e.g. file:///usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-1.45/html/chunk.xsl), 
your catalog is OK. Otherwise, you need to fix it - see 
http://xmlsoft.org/catalog.html for background info and 
http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/docbook.html for a script that will do it for
you. 


Of course, you can also just hard-code the path to your local copy of
stylesheets in general-cutomization.xsl - making it non-portable. The
choice is yours.
