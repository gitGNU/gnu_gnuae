GnuAE is a program, for designing alternate energy system.

After restartin the GnuAE project after a few years, it now has a
slightly different focus. Rather than go through the pain updating the
old Gtk 1.2 based GUI, I decided that turning GnuAE into a PHP
extension, so it could be used via any web browser was a good
idea. Now most of the internal functions are accessible through PHP,
and I'm slowly creating a new UI in php. Other big changes were
upgrading to the GPLv3, switching to Git, and adding SQL database
support, instead of the csv files.
