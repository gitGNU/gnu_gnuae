	* Makefile.in: Regenerated to get rid of a bogus depenency on
	acconfig.h.

2005-02-21  Rob Savoye  <rob@bertha.welcomehome.org>

	* src/Makefile.am: Remove macros from SUBDIRS.
	* macros/libguppi.m4, gtkextra.m4: Remove macros because they're
	been added to aclocal finally.
	* all Makefile.in files regenerated with 1.9.2.
	* configure, gpv/configure: Regenerated with aclocal 1.9.2 and
	autoconf 2.59 (for Fedora Core 3).

2004-09-29  Rob Savoye  <rob@direwolf.welcomehome.org>

	* src/*.cc, *.h: Update copyright message in all files.

2004-09-19  Rob Savoye  <rob@direwolf.welcomehome.org>

	* src/system.c: Don't include Gtk Extra headers.

2004-09-18  Rob Savoye  <rob@direwolf.welcomehome.org>

	* Makefile.am (install-html): Add target to all makefiles so it'll
	work recursively. This properly installs the generated html files
	so the old Gnome 1.x help system will work. Add targets for making
	tarballs and rpms, since the automake support for this isn't
	sufficient.
	* redhat/gnuae.spec: New config file for making rpm packages.
	* debian/{changelog,conffiles,control,copyright,postinst,preinst,rules}:
	New config files for making Debian packages.
	* configure.in: Don't use /* */ with AH_TEMPLATE.
	* Add template to keep autoheader happy.
