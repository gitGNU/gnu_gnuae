GnuAE is a program, for designing alternate energy system.

After restartin the GnuAE project after a few years, it now has a
slightly different focus. Rather than go through the pain updating the
old Gtk 1.2 based GUI, I decided that turning GnuAE into a PHP
extension, so it could be used via any web browser was a good
idea. Now most of the internal functions are accessible through PHP,
and I'm slowly creating a new UI in php. Other big changes were
upgrading to the GPLv3, switching to Git, and adding SQL database
support, instead of the csv files.


Getting the database setup:

Currently the use of MySQL is pretty much hardcoded, although I'd love
to add sqlite support in the future. There are two files in the data
directory that can be used to setup the initial database, and another
one used by the test suite. Those files are:

    data/gnuae.sql
    data/gnuaetest.sql

Then create the databases, which are initially empty. The data files will
populate this database with the data from the file.

mysqladmin -uroot -p###### create gnuae
mysql -uroot -p###### gnuae < gnuae.sql 

mysqladmin -uroot -p###### create gnuaetest
mysql -uroot -p###### gnuaetest < gnuaetest.sql 

Then once created, you have to grant access to a user for the table, and then
flush the priviledges to make it take effect.

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON gnuae.* TO gnuae@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'gnuae';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON gnuaetest.* TO gnuae@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'gnuae';
flush privileges;
