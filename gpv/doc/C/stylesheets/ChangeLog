2002-02-26  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	* toc.xsl: changed so that book TOC shows only parts and chapters,
	and part TOC only shows chapters - no sect*. Chapter and article
	TOC's are unchanged  (i.e., they show up to sect2). Later we might
	want to fine-tune it to make part TOCs show chapters and sect1's.  

2002-02-22  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	* parttitle.xsl: makes part titles to be shown as 
	   Part I. Title, rather than just "Title"

2002-02-21  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	* glossary.xsl: fix it so that it only uses <dt> for glossterm
	inside glossentry, not for inline use of glossterm. 

2002-02-12  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	* admonitions.xsl: fixed a typo in default graphic extension (it
	shouldn't include the dot)

	* revhistory.xsl: let the templates just output content of <revnumber>
	tag, rather than trying to be samrt and construct the entry by
	combining <title> with <revnumber> (what if title has
	changed?). Also changed templates accordingly. 

	*revhistory.xsl, l10n.xml: replace "Revision History" by "History"
	on the titlepage

	
2002-02-08  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	* l10n.xml: added stuff to make <xref> (to sections) produce
	just section title, no junk like "the section called". 

2002-02-07  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	* othercredit.xsl: new file (to give othercredit tag same
	 treatment as authors)
	
	*authors.xsl: streamline the code; add support for editors and
	 othercredit (details of other credit - in a separate file, othercredit.xsl)

	* general-customization.xsl: include othercredit.xsl

	*titlepage2.xsl: correct typos ("article" instead of "book" in 2
	places)
	
2002-02-03 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* general-customization.xsl, README: change to refer to version
	1.45 of Norman Walsh's stylesheets, instead of "current", because

	* author.xsl. l10n.xml: i18n for words "affiliation" and "Email"
	* author.xsl: correct handling of  <author> *not* in
	<authorgroup> (still doesn't  make Author(s) heading, but at least
	correctly shows affiliation and  email). Needs more work. 

2002-01-30  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	stylesheet to use canonical URI. trusting libxml to use  your XML
	catalog to find a local copy. 

	* revhistory.xsl: Changed the way author and publisher are
	encoded, using <para role="publisher"> (nicer than scanning for
	string Publisher: - which would be a headache for i18n). Also, it
	now allows more than one author per revision and correctly handles
	douments which do not use the templates and use <revdescription>
	for description. 
	
	* updated README file
	* titlepage.xsl, titlepage.xml: removed titlepage.separator

2002-01-28  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	  titlepage code in autogenerated one (in titlepage.xsl) and hand-created
	  (titlepage2.xsl). Add on the TOC page title/subtitle of the
	  document and link to "About this document" right under it 

2002-01-28  Alexander Kirillov  <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>
