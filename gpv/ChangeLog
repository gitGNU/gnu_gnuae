	* src/system.c: Don't include Gtk Extra headers.

	* Makefile.am (install-html): Add target to all makefiles so it'll
	work recursively. This properly installs the generated html files
	so the old Gnome 1.x help system will work. Add targets for making
	tarballs and rpms, since the automake support for this isn't
	sufficient.
	* redhat/gnuae.spec: New config file for making rpm packages.
	* debian/{changelog,conffiles,control,copyright,postinst,preinst,rules}:
	New config files for making Debian packages.
	* configure.in: Don't use /* */ with AH_TEMPLATE.
	* Add template to keep autoheader happy.
